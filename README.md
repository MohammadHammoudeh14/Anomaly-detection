Anomaly Detection with KMeans
This project demonstrates a simple example of anomaly detection using synthetic data generated with make_blobs.

KMeans clustering is applied to group the data and detect outliers based on their distance from cluster centers.

Features
Generate synthetic data with sklearn.datasets.make_blobs
Apply KMeans for unsupervised anomaly detection
Visualize clusters and anomalies using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Workflow
Generate dataset
Fit KMeans model
Calculate distances to centroids
Mark distant points as anomalies
Visualize the results

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
Visualizations

The project includes plots showing clusters and detected anomaly points.
